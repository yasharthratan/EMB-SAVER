## Track Chosen - OPEN INNOVATION

## WHY THIS ?

In these time of global pandemic and an increase in the culture of Work From Home, there are a lot of scenarios where you do not want to show your meeting to the people around you. Hence, we are trying to develop a BROWSER EXTENSION for web apps like Google Meet , Zoom, etc., which prevents people from peeping into your work. Our focus is to blur everything important to save your privacy in public and unblur them on hovering.

## SOLUTION :-

We have implemented an efficient anti-peeping, pro privacy, browser extension to prevent people from snooping into your screen during important meetings and preventing you from embarrassment while using the most used web apps like Google meet and Zoom Meetings .

## WORKING :- 

We blur the sensitive areas on toggle using custom CSS and DOM manipulation, which is initiated on onCheck listeners attached to the popup. At the moment we are building it for web apps like Google Meet and Zoom. For Google Meet , the extension can blur out the list of participants, chat messages, video , user badge and the username of entering and exiting participants. For Zoom , the extension blurs out the video , the list of participants and the chat messages.





## Instructions to run :-
1. Download the source code and go to your browser's extension tools.
2. Turn on Developer mode.
3. Click on Load Unpacked.
4. Select `src/` and let it load.
5. Turn on the main toggle manually by clicking (The toggle next to "Turn me on") or Hit "Alt + X" to turn on the extension!
6. Focus on meeting without any worries. ✌️

## Tools Used :-
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Chrome Extension
